# count:
#
#   This covers pretty much any time that a specific number of things
#   is represented! It's sectioned... like an alignment chart meme...
#
#   First counting specific wiki objects, then more abstract stuff,
#   and finally numerical representations of kinds of quantities that
#   aren't really "counting", per se.
#
#   These must be filled out according to the Unicode Common Locale
#   Data Repository (Unicode CLDR). Check out info on their site:
#   https://cldr.unicode.org
#
#   Specifically, you'll want to look into the Plural Rules for your
#   language. Here's a summary on what those even are:
#   https://cldr.unicode.org/index/cldr-spec/plural-rules
#
#   CLDR's charts are available online! This should bring you to the
#   most recent table of plural rules:
#   https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/latest/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html
#
#   Counting is generally done with the "Type: cardinal" section on
#   that chart - for example, if the chart lists "one", "many", and
#   "other" under the cardinal plural rules for your language, then
#   your job is to fill in the correct pluralizations of the specific
#   term for each of those.
#
#   If you adore technical details or want to better understand the
#   "Rules" column, you'll want to check out the syntax outline here:

# listingPage:
#
#   There are a lot of listings! Each is automatically generated and
#   sorts or organizes the data on the wiki in some way that provides
#   useful or interesting information. Most listings work primarily
#   with one kind of data and are sectioned accordingly, for example
#   "listAlbums.byDuration" or "listTracks.byDate".
#
#   There are also some miscellaneous strings here, most of which are
#   common to a variety of listings, and are often navigational in
#   nature.
